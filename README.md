# Spatial_scales_on_the_inference_of_drivers_behind_species_distribution
The factors that determine species distributions across landscapes have for long served keen interest to conservation biology. Abiotic factors have been the major determinants of species distribution at larger scales whereas biotic
factors have been considered to be at small scales. The effect of a factor at one scale cannot be extrapolated to other scales. So to understand these effects, we need to make comparisons at multiple scales. Although there has been
several progressive research studies done on the effects of spatial scales on species distributions, empirical studies involving varying more than one factor have been lacking. I develop a model that uses two factors of growth rate
and carrying capacity as the key drivers of species distribution in a landscape.

Each factor here has its own spatial autocorrelation and speciesâ€™ responses to these factors vary as the spatial scales increase from local to regional to global scales. I represent these factors as two fractal landscapes and implement an
integro difference equation (IDE) on them. The results obtained tell us how the population density is dependant on the growth rate and carrying capacity.

Keywords: Spatial scale; fractal landscape; spatial autocorrelation; integrodifference equations; hierarchical partitioning.
This Figure illustrates the spatial dynamics of the integro difference equation on a fractal landscape.
